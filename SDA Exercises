Exercise 5
Problem to solve
Write a code, which takes two integer number as an input and then perform math operations

addition
subtraction
multiplication
division
raising to a power (in that case first argument will be a number raised to power, second argument will be a power number.
The result of operation should be assigned to newly initialized variable of correct type.

Result should be displayed in correct way on the screen

addition -> "a = A, b = B, results is C"
subtraction -> "a = A, b = B, results is C"
multiplication -> "a = A, b = B, results is C"
division -> "a = A, b = B, results is C"
raising to a power -> "a = A, raised to power B, gives us C"

Input first integer number
10
Input second integer number
20
a = 10, b = 20, result is  30.0
a = 10, b = 20, result is -10.0
a = 10, b = 20, result is 200.0
